// MVP 1 - Add all product data to Firebase (images, price, title, etc)

    // Set up a project on Firebase
    // Import the database object, and any required Firebase modules at the top of the main app file (app.js)
    // Call getDatabase() and ref() to create a reference to the Firebase database
    // Push the products one by one to Firebase then delete the object in local JS file
    // Get products from Firebase to populate product section of website



// MVP 2 - Display the number of items currently added to the user's cart

    // Add randomly generated Firebase key to the corresponding add-to-cart buttons in the HTML

    // Add event listeners to the cart buttons

        // When the buttons are clicked, add the products with the corresponding key to the cart
        // Set the added products to the cart node in Firebase with the corresponding key
        // Increase the count on the shopping cart as users add items to it
            // Create a let variable to hold the number of items in cart
            // Find the products section on the page with querySelector
                // Add an event listener to the section
            // If event target is a button, add 1 to the variable
            // Find .cart-count on the page
            // Set the innerHTML to the variable
            // Style it so it looks nice


// MVP 3 - Allows users to view what has been added to their cart.

    // Create a popup with details of the products added to the cart (and a checkout button!)
    
        //in the html add a div element to hold the pop up details
        //add event listener to the cart button
        //select the div element for popup and add innerHTML with these details.

        //update the logic in the cart-icon button so that we can get the button id and use it to get the matching product from firebase.
            // once we have the product, add it to the cart object in firebase.
            //if it exists in the cart just increase the number, else add to cart 

        





        
        // Automatically add the price of all items in the cart and display the subtotal
        // Add an input field that allows the user to increase (or decrease) the amount of each item in cart
        // Add a button for each product that allows the user to delete the product completely
